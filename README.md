#UiTID plugin
##For CakePHP

Allow authentication of users via UiTID. Uses a customised Vendor library for OAuth, so your default OAuth library will not work.

This repo is an abstraction of code used in another project. The abstraction has not been tested yet, so you could run into some errors. 
I will complete this once I have some free time on my hands. If you are having trouble, just send me a tweet or mail, and I'll respond 
pretty fast.
